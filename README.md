## Why I made greenhouse doodle ?

This project was created as part of the interview process at [Blue Sky Analytics](https://github.com/blueskyanalytics)

Greenhouse gas emissions have been increasing significantly. This project can be used to analyse how the countries have been polluting the air in last couple of years.

This project has 2 data visualisation tools : a line chart and a map. Line chart can be used to analyse the emission (in kilotons) vs year. And the map colors all the countries according to their emissions in a particular year.
